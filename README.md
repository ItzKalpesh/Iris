🌸 Iris Flower Classification

A machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — using scikit-learn. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and prediction with the famous Iris dataset.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can accurately predict the species of iris flowers based on four features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

📂 Dataset: Iris Dataset (Kaggle)

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python 3

scikit-learn → Model training & evaluation

NumPy / Pandas → Data handling

Matplotlib / Seaborn → Data visualization

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
